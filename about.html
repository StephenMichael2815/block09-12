      <p>
        Hiking gives me the thrill of seeking and exploring new places that
        excite me, you never know what you will find when exploring out in the
        beautiful wilderness and seeing all the different plants and animals.
        Also understanding how to respect nature while enjoying it's
        peacefullness gives me a new appreciation for what I love about the
        world around me. Something that also makes me love hiking is trying to
        get to the trails because sometimes it can be very tricky getting to
        where you need to go especially so far away from civilization. It is
        always interesting though, the farther away you go from civilization the
        more you feel connected to it, in some way feeling so small among the
        forest and mountains makes you want to acomplish big things!

      <p>
        Violin has been a part of my life even as a child, feelin the instrument
        while I play instead of looking at what I am doing is the most
        exhilarating part of playing any instrument. It has a special connection
        with you and the world around you, playing with your heart instead of
        always thinking with your mind gives me a break from the harsh reality
        that can sometimes overwhelm anyone that dares try and face any trial in
        front of them. When you are able to take away that extra noise around
        you and create something that is special to you, that is what makes
        playing my violin truly powerful because you become an unstopable
        source, where nothing can hurt you in that small moment of simply
        playing an instrument.

      <p>
        Reading is another one of the fuctions that allows you to not let
        yourself get caught up in the noises of reality, everyone pulling one
        way or another but instead you get to read someone elses story while
        creating your own version at the same time. Being able to use art and
        the incredible diversity of your own imagination is what makes life
        truly amazing, my favorite is finding something that is a more simple
        biography that lets me fill in the gaps and allows me to add my own
        flare to the story. It always helps to take your mind off the unknown
        for what we do not know we should never worry about, worry is something
        that I do far too often and being able to sit back and imagine myself
        inside a story that I can see my own heart a part of is truly exemplary!
